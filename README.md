# Remind Me!
A Discord Bot that sends a message notifying you of a set reminder on the Social Media Platform, Discord. You are able to pass in the reminder, as well as when you want it to be sent.

## Requirements
You'll need the following to be able to run this:
- `discord`
- `discord.ext`
- `aysyncio`
- `datetime`

To install the libraries run:
```
pip3 install discord
```
Replace discord with discord.ext as well.

## Usage
To use the bot, you first use the command `!timeremind`, where you set a reminder at a specific time on the 24-hour clock.
The first piece of data inputted is the hour of the day, followed by the minute, and finally the reminder itself.

Alternatively, you can use the `!remind` command to set a reminder a set time after you send the message. The first piece of data inputted is the message, followed by how many hours after you want the reminder, followed by the minutes, and finally seconds
